# Objects and Context

## Learning Objectives

### Objects
- Explain how objects are defined as data structures
- Create objects using object literal syntax.
- Practice interacting with properties of literal objects.
- Explain nested data structures.
- Explain the difference between object properties and methods.
- Write an object method.

### Context
- Explain Javascript 'context' and what the value of the 'this' keyword refers to
- Explain what the default context of Javascript executing in the browser is
- Use the 'this' keyword to set and retrieve a property in a Javascript function
- Use bind to create a new method bound to an object context
- Use apply/call to execute a method in a different context

## Framing (5 / 05)
[// Todo]: # ( Framing needs to be overhauled )

This lesson will cover two concepts that are crucial for encapsulation and abstraction in Javascript: Objects and Context. Objects allow us to box up multiple functions and data under a single variable. Context is similar to scope.

To explore these concepts we will be looking at a series of examples that unveil the mechanics of scope and context. Through comparing and contrasting code examples look that seem similar yet contain important differences, we'll highlight how scope and context operate in Javascript. The examples ultimately aim to illustrate that the way that code is written and structured affects ***how and where its program data (its variables or references) can be accessed***.
